SentiStrength_DE: German version of lexica for SentiStrength 
-------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION
-------

SentiStrength_DE Version: v5 (Oct.2011)

SUMMARY
-------

SentiStrength_DE is a collection of German lexicon files to be used
for sentiment classification with the SentiStrength classifier
(Cf. http://sentistrength.wlv.ac.uk/ ) from the University of Wolverhampton.

The SentiStrength_DE lexica have been produced by Hannes Pirker at the
Austrian Research Institute for AI (OFAI, http://www.ofai.at). 

This work was performed within the FP7 EU-ICT Project Cyberemotions
(http://www.cyberemotions.eu/).

VERSION HISTORY
---------------

The "special" lexical files like Booster, Negator etc. were compiled
manually, using the English original as a first source.

The main dictionary file, i.e. the EmotionLookupTable, is based on an 
EmotionDictionary for English (released approx. February 2011) which
was supplied by G.Paltoglou from the University of Wolverhampton.

The English basis mainly comprised entries from LIWC. This lexicon
then was first translated into German using GoogleTranslate. The
results subsequently underwent manual checking, correcting, editing
and significant amount of adding of new words. 

The emotional weights for the German words where usually just copied
from the English original, or manually set using the author's
'intuition'. I.e. no automatic adaptation/correction of emotion
weights has been performed on this lexicon so far!


TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------

File Format
===========

The files come as TAB-separated csv files with Unicode(UTF-8) used for
character encoding.

SentiStrength is making use of the first 2 columns in the lexica
only. The rest of the fields is kept for documentation purposes.

SOURCE vs. fullforms version
----------------------------

The main lexical ressource supplied with SentiStrength_DE is: 
_EmotionLookupTable_v5_SOURCE.csv

This is the version recommended to use for editing.

From this file the following was created:
EmotionLookupTable_v5_fullforms.txt

The rational for using a SOURCE file from which fullforms are created
is explained in the following:

Wildcards vs. full-forms
=======================

One of the specific features of the SentiStrength classifier is its
lack of any linguistic processing, i.e. it does neither use
part-of-speech information nor any kind of stemming or morphological
analysis. All SentiStrength does, is to match words found in a text
against words in a list of dictionaries.

The original English version of the dictionary makes massive use of
wildcards in its lexica.  This is a very simple and powerful mechanism
which comes with a price though. Here we want to point out three major
problems. First, overgeneration: An entry such as "admir*" would
(correctly) match admire, admiring, admiration, admirable etc. but at
the same time (wrongly) matches with admirals and admirality. Second,
problems for the maintainability and transferability. An entry like
"admir*" or "exsta*" is not easily matched with entries in other
dictionaries (e.g. for searching for synonyms) and automatic
translation into other languages is made difficult if not
impossible. Third, for languages with a richer inflectional morphology
than English the wildcard mechanism loses some of its appeal. If
inflection does not only make use of suffixes but also of pre- or
infixes additional lexical entries have to be added to the lexicon. In
German, e.g., a regular verbs already (like "sagen") would need two
entries: one for the stem (sag*) and one for the past participle (
gesagt* ).

One alternative to the usage of wildcards is to use each word's basic
form in the lexicon and then use a morphology program to derive all
inflectional forms from this basis, thus generating a fullform lexicon. 


Upper/lowercase
===============

SentiStrength is owecasing all the texts prior to classification, but
does not do so with the lexicon files. Therefore all entries in the
working-copy of the lexica must be lowercase only, otherwise they will
not be matched.

On the other hand, our tools for generating the whole inflectional
paradigm from a base form are case-sensitive though: German
orthography requires nouns and proper names to be written with
uppercase-initials, and our morphology tools make use of this
property. Therefore we keep proper casing in the manually edited
lexical SOURCE file, and produce all-lowercased copies for actual use
with SentiStrength from this source.


Umlaut/ß/Orthography
====================

In German texts (especially in those to be found in the Internet)
umlauts (ä, ö, ü) are frequently written in ASCII letters only,
i.e. transcribed as ae, oe, ue respectively.  The letter ß can be
transcribed as ss or sz. In addition, due to an orthografic reform
many words formerly spelled with ß ('old orthography') are now
correctly spelled with ss ('new orthography').

In the lexical source the words are entered using proper Umlauts in
UTF8 encoding and the 'old orthography' for ß.

Variants which substitute umlauts and ß with their ASCII versions are
then automatically generated. I.e. from an entry like "süß" also the
variant "suess" will be generated.
