German version of Lexica for SentiStrength 
----
compiled by Hannes Pirker (OFAI) Sep. 2011

The "special" files like Booster, Negator etc. were carefully compiled
manually.

The EmotionLookupTable is based on the EmotionDictionary for English
which was supplied with G.Paltoglou's (University of Wolverhampton)
Lexicon-Based-Classifier approx. February 2011.  The English basis
mainly comprised entries derived from LIWC. This lexicon was then
translated using GoogleTranslate. The results underwent manual
checking, correcting, editing and adding of new words 'on the fly'.

The emotional weights for the German words where in the majority of
cases copied from their English counterparts, or manually set using
the author's 'intuition'. I.e. no automatic adaptation/correction of
emotion weights has been performed on this lexicon so far!

====
v5 specific information
====

* Some manual additions at the end of the file -> look for _v5 (most
  of them are 'motorsport-specific')

* Still chaotic: the majority of entries is using wildcards (hopefully
  placed with care) - for newer entries now lemmata are used ->
  usually these are marked as V_lemma, N_lemma, A_lemma for verbs,
  nouns and adjectives respectively.
